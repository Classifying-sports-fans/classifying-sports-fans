Project Title: Classifying Sports Fans
Members: Mariah Warner, Deepisha Solanki, Rudy Perkins, Ryan Moruzzi, Sujoy Upadhyay, and Jacob Kepes
Project Mentor: Mohammad Noorandisoot

Description of the Dataset: The data for these analyses come from multiple original surveys used in the writing of Fans Have More Friends, a 2022 book by Ben Valenta and David Sikorjak. The surveys were administered by Prodege, an online marketing, consumer polling, and market research company, between February 2021-January 2022 with a purposeful goal of achieving a representative sample of U.S. adults for each survey. 

Research Questions/Problem: Based on self-described fandom alone, some groups, like women, are potentially an untapped market that is not marketed towards. How can we predict different fan activities based on self-reported fandom and demographic variables? What is the likelihood of certain fan behaviors and activities based on self-described fandom and demographic variables? 

Stakeholders: Streaming Services (Hulu, Roku, Amazon, etc.), TV Networks (Fox, ABC/ESPN), Gambling Companies (DraftKings, FanDuel, Fanatics), Sports Teams, and Sports Organizations (NFL, NHL, NBA, etc.) 

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- how well our model predicts fan activites (going to a game, betting, etc.) based off self-described fandom. 

Modeling Approach:
