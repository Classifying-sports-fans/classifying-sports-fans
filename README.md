Project Title: Classifying Sports Fans
Members: Mariah Warner, Deepisha Solanki, Rudy Perkins, Ryan Moruzzi, Sujoy Upadhyay, and Jacob Kepes
Project Mentor: Mohammad Noorandisoot

Description of the Dataset: The data for these analyses come from multiple original surveys used in the writing of Fans Have More Friends, a 2022 book by Ben Valenta and David Sikorjak. The surveys were administered by Prodege, an online marketing, consumer polling, and market research company, between February 2021-January 2022 with a purposeful goal of achieving a representative sample of U.S. adults for each survey.

Research Questions/Problem: Different demographic groups, like women, are often incorrectly excluded from being thought of as sports fans, potentially being an untapped market that is not marketed towards. Do these different groups have varying ways of expressing their fandom or investing in sports? Is there a better way to classify levels of sports fans by taking into account how fandom behaviors have different meanings for different demographic groups? 

Stakeholders: Streaming Services (Hulu, Roku, Amazon, etc.), TV Networks (Fox, ABC/ESPN), Gambling Companies (DraftKings, FanDuel, Fanatics), Sports Teams, and Sports Organizations (NFL, NHL, NBA, etc.) 

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- how well our model predicts fans based off survey data.
